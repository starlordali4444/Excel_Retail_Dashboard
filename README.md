2. **Sales and Profit Analysis**: Analyze sales and profitability trends across different categories and regions.
3. **Category-wise Profit**: Evaluate which product categories contribute the most to profit.
4. **Segment-wise Sales Share %**: Measure sales share across different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
5. **Sales by Country**: Break down sales performance by country.
6. **Top 5 Subcategories**: Identify the top-performing product subcategories.
7. **Bottom 5 Subcategories**: Analyze the least-performing subcategories.
8. **Yearly Sales Trend**: Understand how sales evolve year-over-year.
9. **Return Analysis**: Examine which orders were returned and their impact on profitability.
10. **Top and Bottom Customers**: Highlight the highest and lowest revenue-generating customers.
