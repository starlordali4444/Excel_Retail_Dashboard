# Dynamic Retail Dashboard in Excel

## Overview
This project features a **Dynamic Retail Dashboard** built in Excel, designed to provide comprehensive insights into sales, profitability, shipping costs, and customer behavior across various markets and regions. The dashboard helps business stakeholders and decision-makers optimize strategies by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) across product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions.

## Features
- **KPI Slicer:** A central slicer that dynamically filters and displays all key performance metrics in a single view.
- **Sales vs. Profit Analysis:** Visualizes sales and profit performance across different markets (US, APAC, EU, Africa), helping identify high-revenue and low-profit areas.
- **Order Priority and Shipping Cost Breakdown:** Assesses the relationship between order priority levels (Critical, Medium) and the associated shipping costs across various shipping methods (Same Day, First Class, Second Class).
- **Product Performance by Category:** Compares product categories (Technology, Furniture) and sub-categories (Phones, Accessories, Chairs, etc.) in terms of sales and profit contribution.
- **Customer Segment Analysis:** Analyzes the profitability and purchasing behavior of different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) across markets.
- **Impact of Discounts:** Evaluates how discounting strategies affect overall profitability across markets and product categories.

## Purpose
